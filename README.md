# Binary-Message-Encoding-Scheme
For the purpose of this task we assume a simple message model: 
1. A message can contain a variable number of headers, and a binary payload. 
2. The headers are name-value pairs, where both names and values are ASCII-encoded strings. 


The Simple-Binary-Message-Encoding-Scheme code has several characteristics of clean code. First, it follows a clear and consistent naming convention that makes it easy to read and understand. Second, it uses descriptive variables and function names that indicate their purpose and functionality. Third, it follows a modular design, with separate classes for the message and the message codec. Fourth, it has a well-organized code structure, including appropriate use of white space and indentation, and well-defined functions with clear inputs, outputs, and purposes. Finally, it also has input validation, error handling, and the use of appropriate data types and functions for binary encoding and decoding. Hope you like it ✌️.
